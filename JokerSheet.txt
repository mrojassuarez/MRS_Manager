Paroles de World On Fire

Parler de révolution c'est comme cracher au plafond 
Ça ne fera pas crever le plancher de l'exploitation car 
L'anti-capitalisme est une idée vide 
A moins de ne vivre que du troc, soyons lucide 
L'ère industrielle du siècle dernier 
Puis l'ère informatico-numérique, on ne peut pas nier
La machine est bien huilée, je n'ai rien contre le progrès
Mais le problème toujours le même, les richesses partagées

Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'installer!
Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'exprimer!
Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'installer!
Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'exprimer!

World on fire! World on fire! Fire!
World on fire! World on fire! War!

Taux de croissance à la con, fascisme économique
Faut que ça grimpe chaque année c'est pathologique
Orgasme financier, éjaculation de billets
Sous les pavés la plage privée de ces enculés

Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'installer!
Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'exprimer!

Fantasme assouvi retour à la réalité
Le crack est boursier et la classe ouvrière humiliée
68 et son mois de mai
Une kermesse face aux colères annoncées

Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'installer!
Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'exprimer!
Ne laissez pas la haine du système
Ne laissez pas la haine s'installer!
Ne laissez pas la haine du système

We're scanning the scene
In the city tonight
We're looking for you
To start up a fight
There is an evil feeling in our brains
But it is nothing new
You know it drives us insane

[Chorus]
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy

[Verse 2]
There is no escape
And that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye
To the world you live in
You have always been taking
But now you're giving

//----- 

[Chorus]
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy

[Verse 3]
Our brains are on fire
With the feeling to kill
And it will not go away
Until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
On our minds
Don't try running away
Cause you're the one we will find

[Chorus]
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way
Hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy

You can replace VTK's default output window with one that writes the errors to a file:

vtkOutputWindow *w = vtkFileOutputWindow::New();
w->SetFileName("vtk_errors.txt")
vtkOutputWindow::SetInstance(w);
w->Delete(); // now SetInstance owns the reference

Update process combo box with the materials from support or build platform.

- First: Add one or more icons identifying the type of item belong to the material.
	* P --> Part.
	* S --> Support.
	* B --> Buiuld Platform.
- Second: The current heat treatment name.
- Third: (or behind) The material of the heat treatment.

New solution:
- If the user is importing a material with the same Id than another in the Materials Manager, then Virfac clone the new material with a new Id and a new name (example: Material_Imported_X).
- The user is the responsable to merge the new material into the olda ones using copy-paste for Build Strategies or Heat Treatments.

Automatize all the process as much as possible:
- Automatic test (Unit test, integration test)
- Continuous integration and delivery.
